26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Ans:

class Solution {
 public:
  int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
    int i = 0;

    for (const int num : nums)
      if (i < 1 || num > nums[i - 1])
        nums[i++] = num;

    return i;
  }
};

189. Rotate Array
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Ans:

class Solution {
 public:
  void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    k %= nums.size();
    reverse(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);
    reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
    reverse(nums, k, nums.size() - 1);
  }

 private:
  void reverse(vector<int>& nums, int l, int r) {
    while (l < r)
      swap(nums[l++], nums[r--]);
  }
};

283. Move Zeroes
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Ans:
class Solution {
 public:
  void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
    int i = 0;
    for (const int num : nums)
      if (num != 0)
        nums[i++] = num;

    while (i < nums.size())
      nums[i++] = 0;
  }
};

268. Missing Number
Easy
Topics
Companies
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Ans:
class Solution {
 public:
  int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int ans = nums.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
      ans ^= i ^ nums[i];

    return ans;
  }
};
